Pseudo code end performance(?)

introduce itself/confirm start program
train face gazing
confirm finishing face gazing
train random gazing
confirm finishing random gazing.
for c number of trials:
	while not face found:
		findFace()
	random= takeRandomNumberOnPreference
	PerformBehaviour(random)
	state if ball was found
shut down

Pseudo Code performBehaviour

performBehaviour(randomSearch):
while time<20 and object not found:
	time+1
	rotateHeadSlightlyInRandomDirection
if objectFound
	confirm
updateStrategyPreference

performBehaviour(FaceGazing):
while time<20 and object not found:
	time+1
	direction = getRandomDirectionBasedOnProbAndGaze
	rotate(direction)
updateStrategyPreference
